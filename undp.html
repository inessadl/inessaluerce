							This project is an initiative of the National Council of Justice (CNJ) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

						<p>
							The Plataforma Socioeducativa (PSE), part of Fazendo Justiça, is a software solution designed to facilitate the control and monitoring of socio-educational measures in Brazil.							
						</p>

						<p>
							As the only designer of PSE, I helped the manager with product metrics and strategy and I was responsible for all visual production, including the logo, prototyping user 
							interfaces and crafting presentations. Additionally, I developed the foundation of project’s design system.

						As the only Designer of the project, I helped the manager with product metrics and strategy. I was responsible for all visual production, including branding, prototyping and presentations.

					<p>
						I also started the platform's Design System, in which I've created the component library in Figma, defined the theme and I'm currently customizing the frontend project according to the our patterns and definitions. 
					</p>

					<p>Down below are some screenshots from the begining of the Design System.
						The logo and some components were changed/erased because of the non-disclosure agreement.
